        <P>Article 13(1) of the GDPR provides that:</P>
        <P>&quot;(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are
            collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time
            when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of
            the following information: ... (c) the purposes of the processing for
            which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for
            the processing; (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of
            Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or
            by a third party&quot;.</P>
        <P>Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR provides that:</P>
        <P>&quot;(1) Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent
            that at least one of the following applies: ... (f) processing is
            necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
            controller or by a third party, except where such interests are
            overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
            data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular
            where the data subject is a child.&quot;</P>

        <P>Article 14 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information

            supplied to data subjects.</P>
        <P>Article 13 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information
            is obtained from the data subject, does not include an equivalent
            provision.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, we have included references to general categories of
            data in this document, because this facilitates the identification of
            particular purposes of processing and the legal bases of processing -
            information which does need to be provided under Article 13.</P>

        <P>Article 13(2) of the GDPR provides that, where personal data is
            collected from a data subject, certain information about data subject
            rights must be provided:</P>
        <P>&quot;In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1,
            the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained,
            provide the data subject with the following further information
            necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: ... (b) the
            existence of the right to request from the controller access to and
            rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of
            processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as
            well as the right to data portability; (c) where the processing is
            based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the
            existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without
            affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
            withdrawal; ...&quot;.</P>

            applies: (a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the
            data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the
            accuracy of the personal data; (b) the processing is unlawful and the
            data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests
            the restriction of their use instead; (c) the controller no longer
            needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they
            are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or
            defence of legal claims; (d) the data subject has objected to
            processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether

        <P><B>Section 14.1</B></P>
        <P>Some data controllers and data processors will have an obligation
            to appoint a data protection officer (DPO). The basic obligation is
            set out in Article 37(1) of the GDPR:</P>
        <P>&quot;(1) The controller and the processor shall designate a data
            protection officer in any case where: (a) the processing is carried
            out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in their
            judicial capacity; (b) the core activities of the controller or the
            processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their
            nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and
            systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or (c) the
            core activities of the controller or the processor consist of
            processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to
            Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and
            offences referred to in Article 10.&quot;</P>
        <P>Article 13(1)(b) of the GDPR provides that:</P>
        <P>&quot;(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are
            collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time
            when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of
            the following information ... (b) the contact details of the data
            protection officer, where applicable&quot;.</P>
        <P>See also Article 14(1)(b).</P>
